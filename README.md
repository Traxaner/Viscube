# Viscube

This is a project, which uses.... 3 or less workshop contents and the remainder was made just with Visual Scripting.

I don't care about opinions of visual scripting as it was my first time using it and I wanted to give myself a small challenge with it, it's quite tedious to work with it all the time, you know?

Anyways, onto the project itself. In Viscube you control a block that is forced to move forwards.
There are 50 normal levels, 3 special levels thrown in the middle of it and 3 challenge levels at the end; every level has 1 Coin.
After 10 normal levels the cube changes like, say, gaining the ability to teleport upwards a couple of units.
This game is NOT compatible with controllers, just keyboard and mouse for menuing.
You can leave levels anytime with escape, change camera with [Q] and reset levels with [T].
You can remap the actions in the brackets ingame, reset beeing on 'E' initially should be the case but it is on T so what do I know about it.

As a closing note I WON'T touch up on this project anymore, so this is it's final state.
